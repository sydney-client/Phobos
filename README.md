<h1>Information</h1>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<li>Install Fabric Loader 1.21.1, preferably version 0.15.11 but it doesn't matter</li>

<li>Put the jar in your mods folder</li>
<li>Run the game</li>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<li>Anything that needs to use a real server connection (IRC, cloud configs, whatever that store shit is) will crash/not work</li>
<li>Sometimes the client might launch as a black screen. You might think this is a crack issue, but no, it is an issue with the client</li>
<li>If you have something running on port 7565 or 8080 it will not work</li>

<h2>Technical Information</h2>
<li>The client was cracked in 5 hours through the use of a replay attack</li>
<li>The jar is slightly heavier than the original due to the inclusion of both the Windows and Linux natives</li>
<li>The authentication is terrible and almost non-existent</li>
<li>It is recommended to not use this client</li>
